        Hey there! I'm Ernesto 👋 If you're here, we're probably going to work
        together. This is your guide to how I operate—what drives me, how I
        think, and what you can expect.

                Building systems that multiply team velocity
            </h3>
            <p class="text-sm text-zinc-300">
                The work I'm most proud of isn't solving one problem—it's
                creating abstractions that make entire teams faster. At Dispel,
                I built form libraries, component systems, and architectural
                patterns that turned multi-day tasks into hours. When something
                I build removes friction for multiple developers, that's the
                multiplier effect I'm after.

            <h3 class="text-base font-medium">Staying ahead of the curve</h3>
            <p class="text-sm text-zinc-300">
                I'm always experimenting with emerging tech—especially AI
                tooling—to see how it can improve our workflows and solve
                complex problems. But I only adopt what adds real value. I've
                learned that being forward-thinking means knowing when to push
                for better tools and when to stick with what works.

                Caring deeply about craft and details
            </h3>
            <p class="text-sm text-zinc-300">
                I don't just make things work—I make them feel right. Whether
                it's a form interaction, an email template, or a component API,
                I'm meticulous about the details because I believe great UX and
                solid engineering aren't separate concerns. Thoughtful design
                and clean code compound into products people actually enjoy
                using.

                Making collaboration easy and productive
            </h3>
            <p class="text-sm text-zinc-300">
                I believe the best work happens when it's easy to work together.
                I'm responsive (even under pressure), approach every
                conversation with good intent, and genuinely enjoy collaborating
                with product and design. I give thoughtful PR reviews, help
                teammates debug tricky issues, and try to make showing up to
                work a little more enjoyable.

            </h3>
            <p class="text-sm text-zinc-300">
                Complex features become manageable when you chunk them into
                clear, reviewable increments. I've learned this makes
                development smoother, PRs faster, and delivery more predictable.
                It's a simple habit that compounds over time.

            <h3 class="text-base font-medium">I write to clarify my thinking</h3>
            <p class="text-sm text-zinc-300">
                Writing forces me to find gaps in my logic. Whether it's
                documentation, architectural proposals, or code comments,
                externalizing my thoughts helps me (and others) grasp complex
                systems faster. I also lean on diagrams when visual models make
                things clearer.

            <h3 class="text-base font-medium">I default to good intent</h3>
            <p class="text-sm text-zinc-300">
                When someone questions my approach or suggests something
                different, I assume they're trying to make things better. I ask
                questions to understand their reasoning, not to defend my
                position. I hope you'll do the same with me.

        <div class="space-y-2">
            <h3 class="text-base font-medium">I'm always willing to help</h3>
            <p class="text-sm text-zinc-300">
                Whether it's answering questions, reviewing code, brainstorming
                solutions, or mentoring teammates, I make myself available.
                Great teams push each other forward, and I believe being
                supportive and approachable is part of what makes engineering
                work actually work.

            <h3 class="text-base font-medium">I change my mind when convinced</h3>
            <p class="text-sm text-zinc-300">
                I care more about making the right decision than being right. If
                you bring better reasoning or a clearer path forward, I'll
                happily change direction. Low ego, high conviction—until
                something better shows up.
